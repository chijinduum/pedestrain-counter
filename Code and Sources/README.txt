My name is CHIJINDUM OKPOECHI.

To run the python program, open the file using command prompt or any editor with a terminal that supports Python.
To do this, you search for the directory where the folder is located using its path or you open the folder it is in and you type "cmd" in the directory space that shows you while folders you are in (I personally prefer this way).

you input the following syntax in the terminal to run the program: python project.py -i (the video filename and extension) -t (the name of the table you want to store the results in)

To read the database, you input the following syntax in the same directory: sqlite3 report.db
									    select * from (the table name you used to run the initial program)


If there is anything you want to correct or comment on my code, I would greatly appreciate it.


Thanks and Happy coding!
